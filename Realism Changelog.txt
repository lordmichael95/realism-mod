Realism Mod Changelog

This is my first mod and I hope you enjoy! If you have any questions, comments, concerns, suggestions, or want to get the latest version
of this mod, please visit: http://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/showthread.php?687969-Mod-Realism-Mod


v1.11		Compatible with v1.1
-Added keyboard shortcuts
	-This adds 8 shortcuts to the game: "z","x","c","v","b","n","m" and "`" (tilde)
	-z raises levy directly from any holding you have control over, or from the building screen.
	-x dismisses the currently selected levy (army or ship), *capital* "x" will dismiss ALL selected levies
	-c raises ships in selected holding or building
	-v embarks the currently selected levy into a ship that is IN port in that province
	-b merges selected levies or ships, so long as they are in the same zone or province (naturally). If you have a single army/shipgroup the "b" key will open the new unit interface
	-n selects the trade port screen on coastal provinces
	-m selects the normal holdings screen 
	-` (tilde) is a back button. Please be aware that ` is usually used to open the cheat interface. This does not prevent that functionality, in fact it is a logical button choice considering you can only access the cheat interface when there are no open windows. 
-The interface has been adjusted (see screenshots for more info)
-Made the amphibious landing penalty more severe
-Creating/Usurping fraction of de jure counties that you must control to create a non-imperial title is back to pre 1.10 (50%) rather than 51%
-Culture will now spread even if the religion of a county is the same as the top most liege; Culture will now spread to islands and will spread faster in counties with coast.
-A character dieing from the Duelist trait will no longer get duelist_death
-It is now possible to live until 90

 A big thanks to Arumba for letting me use his interface & shortcuts mod
